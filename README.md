# EEG-Decision-Making-HRC
This user study examines how different factors, including the robot's capabilities and the individual's knowledgeability, can impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes during human-robot collaboration. To collect data, we used an EEG headset to measure brain activity and administered multiple questionnaires to evaluate participants' cognitive perceptions of the robot. We manipulated the robot's capabilities and divided participants into groups based on their computational thinking ability. Our results showed that different levels of computational thinking ability triggered different brainwaves and that participants' trust in the robot also affected brain activity.
